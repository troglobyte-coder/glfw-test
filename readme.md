## tooling

* * *

The targeted audience we are building for is **Windows 10**, **Mac OSX**, **ChromeOS**, and **Linux**
users. This project uses [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) `0.62.0` and newer.

This project is using *Meson build system*, so be sure to review
[The Absolute Beginner's Guide to Installing and Using Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/SimpleStart.html)
then see if you can build this project to prove that everything is all
setup and ready to go. :)

## Setup, Compile and Install

* * *

Firstly the users should set up a project build directory before
compiling:

```console
meson setup builddir
```

The next step should be to compile the target of a configured
Meson project:

```console
meson compile -C builddir
```

Then we install the application like so:

```console
meson install -C builddir
```

And finally we run this cool application:

```console
prog
```
